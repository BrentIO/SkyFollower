# 🇳🇴 no-caa

|---|---|
| **Country** | Norway |
| **Registration prefix** | `LN-` |
| **Data source** | https://data.caa.no/nlr/norgesluftfartoyregister.json |
| **Format** | JSON API (fixed URL) |
| **Run frequency** | Weekly (Wednesday, 06:10 UTC) |
| **Depends on Mictronics for ICAO hex** | No — the register publishes its own ICAO 24-bit address (`Heksadesimal`) for every aircraft, so `icao_hex` is read directly from the source data. |

## How it works

The Norway CAA register is downloaded whole from a fixed URL as a single JSON payload (`{headers, data: [...]}`); no index page or scraping is involved. Each record's ICAO hex is pulled from the `Heksadesimal` field inside the `ICAO 24-bits adresse` array. Aircraft category (`Kategori`) and owner country (`Land`) are decoded via lookup tables — Norwegian names are used for Norway/Sweden/Denmark and English names for everything else — with unmapped values passed through as-is rather than dropped. Owners (`Eier(e)`) is an array that may hold multiple entries; the one flagged `Eier/Kontakt` supplies the registrant's address, while names are collected from every owner entry (contact first, then any others, de-duplicated). Every written record explicitly sets `military: false` — this register is exclusively civil, and the explicit value ensures a stale `military: true` flag (from Mictronics or a prior record on a reused hex) is corrected on re-registration.

## Columns

| `Eier(e)` → `Postnummer` | ✅ | → `registrant.postal_code` |
| `Eier(e)` → `Land` | ✅ | → `registrant.country`, decoded to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 where known |
| `Eier(e)` → `Organisasjonsnummer` | ❌ | Present in source; not read by this runner |

## Example Output

Read back the merged record for a given ICAO hex (combines this runner's data with Mictronics and any other sources that have written to the same key):

docker run --rm --network host redis:latest redis-cli EVAL "$(cat ./shared/lua/merge_aircraft.lua)" 0 478E11 | python3 -m json.tool --sort-keys --no-ensure-ascii
